# Advanced_Algorithms

This repository contains some more advanced algorithms for sorting, sorting in finite universes, searching and trees.
For some algorithms there are short or more advanced tests.

Please see the appropriate file for the exact algorithm.

- 2,3-tree (special case of the a,b-tree)

## General Sorting

- Mergesort
- Quicksort

## Sorting in finite domains

- Countingsort
- Advanced Countingsort
- Bucketsort
- Radixsort

## Order statistics (Select algorithms)

- Randomised Algorithm
- Deterministic Algorithm

## Searching in sorted Arrays

- Binary search
- Interpolation search
- Quadratic binary search
